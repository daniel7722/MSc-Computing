# Chess Coursework

This is a chess coursework that let me practice slightly more complicated Object Oriented Programming. The spec is in **Chess.pdf** please refer to it for further details

To play around with this, you can cd into this directory
```
make
```
and now the program is compiled
```
./chess
```
to execute the executable and voila.
